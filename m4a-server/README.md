# 🍕 #SFYL Bot 🤩

💡 **Inspo**: Everyone's out here making basic bots. We said, "no more"! Introducing #SFYL Bot - the most vibe-worthy, boujee, Gen-Z app out there. If you're looking to flex on your haters, and serve some serious tech looks, you're in the right space. 💅

## 🎤 What's the 411?

This ain't your grandma's bot. This bad boy:
- 🎧 Finds and serves those m4a files because... well, why not?
- 🚀 Uses Redis to cache like a boss. We're talking speed. *Sonic* is shaking.
- 📂 Watches your directories like Kory watches for his meth dealer. Creepy? Maybe. Useful? Heck yes.
- 🎨 Colors the console because life ain't just black and white.
- 🧠 Uses EJS as its view engine. We're all about those views. Drake who?
- 🎉 Drops a fire logo and console messages that are straight fire.

   Just run the app and let it do its thang. It'll keep an eye out for those m4a files and serve them up.

2. **Endpoints**:
   - `GET /baggies` for the main view. Flex on those files.
   - `GET /baggies/fileslist` to get a JSON list of available m4a files. For when you're feeling a bit robot-y.

3. **Redis Connection**:
   If Redis is being a lil' sassy, check the console. We'll let you know what's up. And yes, we're keeping it 💯.

4. **File Watcher**:
   Drop new m4a files into your configured directory and watch as the bot picks them up. It's like magic, but better. 🪄
