## 🎨 Features:

## 🚀 How to Get Started:

1. **Clone the repo**: 

    ```bash
    git clone [YOUR REPO LINK HERE]
    ```

2. **Add your profile pics**: 
    - Throw all the profile pictures you want to use into the `heads/` directory. Make sure they're in `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, or `.gif` format.
    - The code scans this directory and uses these images for the rain. 🌧️

3. **Include your audio and video**: 
    - Replace `harlemshake.mp3` and `video.mp4` with your audio and video files, respectively. If you're feeling extra spicy, use your own tracks! 🌶️

4. **Run it**:
    - Open `index.html` in your favorite browser.
    - Click the `#NOASS` button to start the show!

## 😎 Pro Tips:

- **Customize your vibes**: If you're not feeling the color scheme, fonts, or any other style, dive into `styles.css` and tweak it to your heart's content. Make it your own! 💖
- **Add more interactivity**: If you're all about that coder life, pop open `scripts.js` and add more features or interactivity. The world is your oyster! 🌍
